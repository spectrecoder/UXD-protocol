Since the Metaplex protocol launched last July, creators have used it to mint 5.7 million NFTs with over 600,000 unique wallets holding one. Metaplex’s Candy Machine is responsible for virtually every generative collection in the ecosystem, and its commerce program Auction House is quickly gaining adoption from projects like Fractal that value open protocols, global price discovery, and decentralization."
