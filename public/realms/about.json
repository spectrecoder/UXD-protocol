The protocol offers an open-source framework to manage independent NFT storefronts, which can be fully customized and self-hosted without passing through a centralized authority — all with significantly lower minting and transaction fees. Metaplex is a collection of tools, smart contracts, and more designed to make the process of creating and launching NFTs easier."

Since the Metaplex protocol launched last July, creators have used it to mint 5.7 million NFTs with over 600,000 unique wallets holding one. Metaplex’s Candy Machine is responsible for virtually every generative collection in the ecosystem, and its commerce program Auction House is quickly gaining adoption from projects like Fractal that value open protocols, global price discovery, and decentralization."
